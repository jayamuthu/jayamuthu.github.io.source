      <h1>Replace algorithms with NN </h1>
      <div>This idea of replacing software components with neural networks comes
        to us, or atleast me quite a few times. I remember now the very first
        time I thought about this. At that time, I did not know anything about
        neural networks other than that they are a part of Aritifcial
        Intelligece. I and my friend Suriya were experimenting with lots of
        stuff that we can get our hands on. Arduino, OpenCV, Matlab, Linux,
        device drivers, etc. Yes it was five years ago when we came up with the
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/project-adhi" target="_blank">project</a>
        "Adhi"(means beggining). It was about intergraing AI, NN specifically
        into linux kernel to make it kernel smarter. </div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>There is another one,where I imagined a symbolic AI and nerual
        network will compete to become better than each other. This came to me,
        when thinking of how to adjust what a network learns. Symbolic AI are
        easier to tweak. </div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Like this one, most of the ideas presented below are old and may be
        useless, and I admit, these are all just vague phrases and I never made
        an attempt to implement them. But I hope this time I will get my hands
        dirty and this&nbsp; would at least serve as a reference.
        <div></div>
        <h4>Why am I writing about this now?</h4>
        <div>One. I have been planning to write a software to help with
          tamil-linguitics. There is a lot to discuss in it, But I will limit
          myself to one particular area - WordNet. Two. few months ago I wrote
          about how computers can be more useful that being just a data storing
          searching devices. In that post I tried to explain how we are
          underutilising out computers. I always try to organize the directories
          I have on my computers to aid the way I work. And there are some more
          idea, and a combination of those things led me to write this.</div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>In this post, lets discuss a specific algorithm - indexing. Why? No
        reason. It is way more easier to explain, I guess.</div>
      <div>
        <h3>What is an index?</h3>
      </div>
      <div>Let's say you own stationery store, which sells, papers, notebooks
        and pens. They way you place those items your shop is essential for
        business. Pens are almost always placed at the front. Notebooks are
        placed in wooden or iron racks and are organized interms of their
        attributes - ruled/unruled, long/short, number of pages,
        hard-bound/paperback and etc., and other items which are not frequently
        sold will be kept somewhere in the back. Basically, we keep the
        frequently sold items closer and the others farther. We can think of
        this, as an indexing problem can't we?. The next time we buy notebooks
        to sell, we place them accordingly.</div>
      <div>
        <h4>Indexing and related data-structures:</h4>
      </div>
      <div>Binary-tree can be thought of as decision tree, but it is not as
        sophisticated a decision tree.We, humans out of our lessons came up with
        B-tree. TODO</div>
    </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>We can think of programming in general as way to give structure to
      information/data.That is what we do right? We take in bunch of data and do
      something with it. Before doing with it we need a idea of what it is.</div>
    <div>
      <h4><strong>A remotely relevant example: Games</strong></h4>
    </div>
    <div>Let's take games. Games are one of the crucial softwares. They are
      complex and compuationally intensive and some time they look incredibly
      real. The more real they look, the more computations it has to perform.
      The real world has structure. A computer sits on a table. The table mostly
      stays inside the building. Our hands holds items. Bikes and cards rides on
      the roads. There are numeraous relationships between objects in the real
      world. And there is always more in the real world that what meets the eye.
      But we cannot afford to make the computer build an entire world inside.
      The real world is too rich in complexity to be fit in 32Gb RAM, and the
      physicsal laws are too intense to calculated with a quad core processor. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>So what do we do? We cull off the things that don't meet the eyes and
      display only what is necessary on the screen. How do we do it? Similar to
      real world we simulate a small scale world inside the computer with help
      of 'relationships between items'. Scene graph it is called. It is the data
      structure that contains the objects and their relationships, including the
      player from whose POV we see the world inside the game. So that the
      computer can evaluate what object falls under our view, and only act upon
      them, i.e apply physics over the objects in the view so that we feel
      immersed in the game. To make it more closer to real world. The people who
      create games optimize the game and its engines to run as fast as it can in
      as many hardware platform as possible. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>Different kinds of games build different kind of worlds. GTA Vicecity
      was one of the first open world games I played.But mostgames are of closed
      world nature. i.e you cannot move around freely.There are only a set of
      paths you can go and only a set of things you can do. This in a way
      reduces the complexity in the computation. </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>Have you ever wondered why some games are fast even at high graphical
      quality settings and some games suck even atlow quality settings. That
      depends upon whatoptimization havebeen done and whohasdone it.Naturally a
      game programmer with good experience can optimize their games better than
      one with lesser experience.</div>
    <div>
      <h4>A extrememly remotely relevant example: Software</h4>
      <div>The sotware we use,&nbsp; Microsoft word or Libre office Writer, are
        general purpose software. Almost every one will have some use for it.
        There is a set of usual things we do with a computer. Write docs, paint
        pictures, watch videos and such. But there are also specialised
        softwares designed for specific purpose. For example banks use custom
        designed software. The functionality of software is tailored its
        industry. You need measurements to tailor stuff.</div>
      <div>
        <h4>A relevant example: Out stationery store</h4>
      </div>
      <div>The way you store items in you shop will differ from other shop, even
        if it was a stationery store right next to yours or right opposite. Why
        it dependsupon so many factors. The kind of items you sell, the number
        of items in each kind, the amount of space you have etc. i,e how you
        store, depends heavily on what you have. Index is a function of data.</div>
    </div>
    <div><br>
    </div>
    <div>Let's think about, database coders specifically people who code the
      indexers. They cannot make any predictions about what kind data would be
      stored in the databases other than few bare essentials like integers and
      string. They cannot know what kind of data that I am going to store. It is
      this disconnect which penalises performance.</div>
    <div>
      <h4>Coming back to WordNet</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>Wordnet is like a thesaurus but richer in information. Building a
        wordnet is no simple task. It is not exaggerating, when I say it might
        take one's lifetime to build one. How can we make use of computer in
        this endevour? This is a crude example and by no means intended to be
        comprehesive implementaion note.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Let's say you have software, you lookup a word and it shows some
        information regarding that word. Its meanings, etymology, different of
        forms of use in sentences, etc. What if it can suggest a list of words
        and you can edit the relationship between them, i.e if the suggested
        list of words are closer to this word in some sense? Wouldn't it be
        awesome?</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>But how can we pick a list of words from million words closer to the
        one that we are reading? Well what if we can store the words in database
        based on their similarity and relationships with other words? i.e store
        the words closer in meaning, closer in memory.You mayask how can we know
        what words are similar and what are not? </div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>That is where machine learning comes in. There are machine learning
        methods, word embedding for example can be used to come with a
        similarity metric. And manual contributions via this linguistic software
        inturn can be used to make it more accurate. Remember the meaning of the
        words are always changing, and there is not absolute meaning and
        relationship between a word and the meaning it represents. So this
        process will always be incremental and iterative. </div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>The point is, neural networks and other machine learning methods can
        be use to determine where and how to store words.Unlike a general
        purpose database, the neural network will learn what is in the data so
        that it can store the data more efficiently and effectively.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I imagine a bunch of AI agents talking to each other can do a better
        job at this than a handful of coders.</div>
